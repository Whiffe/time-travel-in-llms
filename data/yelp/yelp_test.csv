"I was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice, sunny day and we decided to drive to Waterfront and walk around. All around great day until we hit Bar Louie for some drinks and appetizers. I am giving it one star, though it deserves none, because our waitress was nice, if a bit inattentive, and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good. Outside of that Bar Louie leaves a lot to be desired. This is probably the first place I've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. To me, that is beyond ridiculous. Bar Louie is not an upscale restaurant, as much as they wish they were, and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined. As I mentioned the waitress was friendly, but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough. I really wanted to like this place because of things I had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good, but if it want to spend that kind of money, I'll go somewhere that I can get good service.",0 (1 star),"I was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice, sunny day and we decided to drive to Waterfront and walk around.

"I was quoted a price for a new pair of glasses and lenses that were in the 50% area. Came back the next day excited to buy the glasses and was told the glasses were not on sale for 50% and that the quote someone gave me the day before was wrong. The new quote was DOUBLE what I was quoted the day before! Not only was I disappointed about the price, but the sale associate was rude and didn't care about what had happened. I will never shop at Lens Crafters ever again. What a horrible experience! I also came in many times before and the employees never helped me. They were just sitting down doing nothing. I honestly don't know how they are able to stay in business if they don't help customers or at least ask.",0 (1 star),I was quoted a price for a new pair of glasses and lenses that were in the 50% area.

Awful place. If you are trying to go there for good drinks this is an OK place to go to but the food was horrible. The tapas ceviche was $10 which came with 4 shrimp and was topped with popcorn (I have no idea why). If they were trying to go for fun and innovative food this place completely missed the mark. The potatoes and chorizo came in an extremely small portions and where bland. Not to mention the paella which was $25 and the rice was not well cooked. This place takes small portions to a new level. Overall I left that place with $80 less and still hungry. Not worth the money and the food was a complete disappointment. The only reason this place is getting two stars is because of their drinks.,1 (2 stars),Awful place.

I called and orders three sandwich platters and a veggie platter for pick up the day before I needed them. I show up and no sandwiches! No order! Nothing! They also wrote pick up time wrong on another order so us two customers were fighting to get our orders made first. On top of it all customer service was rude. Bad experience all around! The only reason for the two stars is for the poor deli staff working furiously to make 100 sandwiches in no time flat.,1 (2 stars),I called and orders three sandwich platters and a veggie platter for pick up the day before I needed them.

"What to do on Christmas Eve eve... oh, Carolina Place Mall is open 'til 11pm? Let's go wander around there and watch the masses scramble for gifts. When I need to make a mall trip, this is not at the top of the list for me. I rank Northlake, SouthPark and Concord all above it. One: anything that involves 485 does not make me pleasant. Two: The store selection here is just kind of meh. Three: it's a pain to get in and out of this place. Now I will say this, there is an H&M on the way which could be a game changer for this place. It will be great for people on the south side of town since currently there is just the one location up at Northlake. Until SouthPark gets one, this one will do for our side of town. Typical anchor stores here. I don't want to say that it feels outdated... I don't think that's the right description. Maybe old school vibe is more accurate. If I'm near this area and need a mall, I'll venture here. But with so many better options in the Charlotte area, it's definitely not a must-go shopping destination on my list.",2 (3 stars),"What to do on Christmas Eve eve... oh, Carolina Place Mall is open 'til 11pm?

Upstream is probably thought of as one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. I am from Philadelphia where there are excellent restaurants with iron chefs so my viewpoint may be a bit skewed. The food was good but not great or amazing. Every dish (except the house salad) was over salted. My husband had the tuna and I had the seabass. They were both very good but as I said before not great. We would go there again but for sushi/raw items not necessarily the cooked menu items. The salad was was the highlight for me (house salad) and the crab bisque was pretty tasty too. Overall the service was very good but slow. Our waiter was one of the most knowledgeable wait staff we have encountered since moving from PA.,2 (3 stars),Upstream is probably thought of as one of the best restaurants in Charlotte.

"I can't believe no one has reviewed this place! Given its location in the middle of a residential area, its mostly a locals joint. In fact, I know quite a few people who probably eat here more than 4 times a week. The food is always great, lots of veggies and county style entrees. Not sure if this is where I would go on a diet, but needless to say, I am not. The bar is well stocked (and always cheap domestic beer specials), but not always with the most enjoyable of a crowd. But hell, who cares. I would recommend sunday lunch specials. I'll probably be there, so say hello.",3 (4 stars),"I can't believe no one has reviewed this place!

"Rito's easily has the best red chile and beans in the world, maybe even universe- now that Pluto is not a planet. Don't be scared by the wussies that say the area is scary- I guess when you live in Sun City- the big city can be scary. On any given day the place will be packed with city workers, CPAs, medical staff from Good Sam, teachers and the occasional sketchy dude. This family owned spot puts out amazingly good food. The menu is limited-but it's all about quality not quantity. I do not feel that the food is overpriced at all. You are buying fresh made food with soul-if you want heartless crap hit Taco Hell on McDowell. If you live a charmed life and they're selling tacos when you are there- for the love of heysoos- buy three. The guacamole tacos are amazing. If they were to become illegal- I would rob old people so I could support my habit. If only they would step up their game and offer fountain drinks- that would be great. Cans of soda do not help during hot summer months.",3 (4 stars),"Rito's easily has the best red chile and beans in the world, maybe even universe- now that Pluto is not a planet.

"Let's say I am slightly biased, because I'm pretty certain I am Girasole's biggest fan... No seriously... I recently moved to Houston (well 5 years ago now), and I literally arrange to meet family and friends at Girasole, because as much as I love my family and friends, let's face it, I plan my trips home around Girasole. I never miss the chance to dine here...and I typically will skip lunch as I tend to eat a lot... hey Houston does NOT have decent Italian food and even if they did, it wouldn't be Girasole! I ALWAYS have the spinach & ricotta ravioli with the salad AND of course I never skip the Gnocchi (I swear both sauces are some of the BEST in the entire world)... I usually skip white bread, but not here, I use it to scoop up the extra sauce. The tiramisu and lemon cake are to die for as well. Be sure to tell Pi aka Mr. Girasole that Emilie from TX sent you... it's literally my home away from home!",4 (5 stars),"Let's say I am slightly biased, because I'm pretty certain I am Girasole's biggest fan...

"Driving up to the place, you contemplate if you should have brought your bullet proof vest. You pull in, see that nothing has been touched since 1950, and fall into deep thought about the greatness that's going to enter your mouth. You look at the menu (with taped over prices) and order through the original Alexander Graham Bell phone. Can't understand what the lady is saying back to you? WHO CARES!! All you need to do is order the BBQ Minced sandwich and a 1/4 BBQ chicken (white meat). Yeah, some people say the sandwich could have more BBQ sauce on it, but those people need to walk out onto Wilkinson with their eyes closed.You won't find another place like this in the world, i promise...I've looked. The people that work there make this place especially unique. The guys are funny, quick, and they were shirts with holes in them. Overall, if you are in Charlotte, you better go there. Make sure you bring Cash with you because Credit Cards are not allowed.",4 (5 stars),"Driving up to the place, you contemplate if you should have brought your bullet proof vest.
