"Three strikes and you're out! We had brunch there a few months back, and the meal was so salty that we could barely begin to eat it. That meal was comped and I figured it was an off day. We went back about a month later for dinner, and that meal was also very salty and we could not finish it. We were willing to try again, so we went for dinner tonight. I ordered the filet, and it was like eating a salt shaker. I was shocked that, for a third time, I had a piss poor meal at Casbah. I sent that back, and ordered the sea bass. When I got to the end of the piece of fish, it was raw. Needless to say, I will NEVER return to this restaurant. Looking back, what should I have expected from the sister restaurant of Mad Mex?",0 (1 star),"Three strikes and you're out!

"I have been in this bar many times with a friend of mine (who has been a patron for decades) and I thought the owners were really nice people but now I wonder. My friend is now confined to a wheelchair and still likes to frequent this bar, however, there are a couple of steps that lead into the back rooms where there are pool tables, dart boards, etc. She cannot get to this area and has a ramp that she would give to the owners so she can access this area. They refuse to put in the ramp. I thought all public businesses had to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act as long as it does not create an undue hardship. Tell me, how is putting down a ramp that is given to you for free a hardship! SHAME ON YOU CATHY!",0 (1 star),"I have been in this bar many times with a friend of mine (who has been a patron for decades) and I thought the owners were really nice people but now I wonder.

"I have been a customer of the Triangle Bar & Grill for over twenty five years. They have the BEST subs ever. BUT on this trip I was buying several to share with people from out of town. They are cash only and more than happy to show you an ATM that charges you $2.50 per transaction. The employees don't set the rules but have to live with them. That $2.50 came out of their tip, they can hit up their boss for the rest. Its 2014 and they still don't take credit and or debit cards. Shame on them.",1 (2 stars),"I have been a customer of the Triangle Bar & Grill for over twenty five years. They have the BEST subs ever.

"Not exactly a fan of this location, however I tend to frequent it because of my work location, but I always leave unsatisfied. The baristas are not friendly. I'm always always always made to feel like I'm stupid (seriously? i'm ordering coffee from you - who gave you a Masters Degree of all things brewed?) and they're just rude. Just.... rude. I've never had an issue with my order being accurate, although again, just ordering coffee people. I'm not asking you to recite the Gettysburg address.. in Latin.. backwards. Just asking for a coffee.. congrats on getting it right! I wwill also add that everytime I go in to this store, it smells.. bad. real bad. not like the delicious aroma of fresh brewed coffee. No no. You know those febreze commercials where they take the most disgusting atmosphere for smell and throw poor, unsuspecting victims in there to test the febreze-ee-ness of the area? Yeah, it's like that. Only with no febreze. To sum it up, I would suggest if you're in the area and need some starbucks in your life, take a few extra steps and go to the one on the corner of 6th and penn. Those people are SUPER friendly (gave me a free coffee on new years day because I was on my way to work and realized I forgot my credit card after I ordered for me and my coworkers.. so nice!) and it smells like a coffee shop should smell - like coffee. WHOA.. mind. blown.",1 (2 stars),"Not exactly a fan of this location, however I tend to frequent it because of my work location, but I always leave unsatisfied. The baristas are not friendly.

"I love the concept but I think it is overrated. I have been hearing so much hype about Primanti Brothers that I was so excited to finally get to stop in at one. I have no problem with the size or amount of grease, I just don't get the greatness of the sandwiches. We ordered the Kolbassi & Cheese and the Pitts-burger cheesesteak (#2 best seller). I had half of each one along with cheese fries. I thought both sandwiches were a little dry especially the cheesesteak. The coleslaw seemed to be too dry for my taste or maybe it was the abundance of fries that dried everything out for me. I am not a big fry fan in the first place. I would like to see some other options for bread like a wheat or whole grain option. I would also recommend putting extra cheese on the sandwich as I couldn't even taste cheese. I like cheese and they need more to help balance the dryness. Service was a little lame as I barely could understand our ""too cool"" server. He seemed disinterested in us for the most part. The pregnant waitress who helped us out once seemed more congenial and helpful. I like the fact that it is small and fast. I just don't get the vast appeal. I need sauces, fresh ingredients, whole grains, and cheese. I would recommend for everyone to try the place once but I bet there is better options in the Burg.",2 (3 stars),"I love the concept but I think it is overrated.

"This location is much better than some of the other downtown Pittsburgh locations, but only because the guy who makes my create your own salads is really really friendly. I love that you can create your own salad; however, for $7.99, I wish the lettuce was always at the peak of freshness. It sometimes is, it sometimes isn't. I like the variety of soups; however, if you want mac and cheese, come early because they always run out of it. The tuscan bean is good, as is the tomato bisque. The roast beef with herbed cheese on a baguette is my favorite sandwich, and this one has never every let me down. Perhaps if the prices were a little lower, I would be more satisfied with the quality of the food.",2 (3 stars),"This location is much better than some of the other downtown Pittsburgh locations, but only because the guy who makes my create your own salads is really really friendly.

"I really like this Saks. It's close to my job so I am in there all the time! Antoine takes care of me with my clothing purchases every time I am there. Tom is my guy for Bond no.9. He sends out postcards telling me about new Bond fragrances and in store Bond events all the time. He always is hooking me up with a free sample when I come in! Reshonda is my girl for all other fragrances. If I want to try something and they don't have a sample she will make me one right on the spot! Now that's service! I would give the store a 5 put the interior SUCKS! It is too small and needs a major updating. It looks like Kaufmann's, Gimbel's or Horne's from back in the 80's. The fragrance counter is too small. The men's section is down in the basement and only half of the floor is men's. The rest is house ware. The majority of the men's section is suits. Can we get some Gucci or Prada clothing not just shoes? They really need to expand or move across the street to the old Lord & Taylor building!",3 (4 stars),I really like this Saks.

"Always a good time, although it's definitely not a place I would visit often. It's great for groups....which is quite obvious since there are always several folks there for bachelorette parties and birthdays. Shut out to the piano players, who can not only play the piano, but also sing, play the drums and the sax. They are funny and know how to keep a crowd entertained. Also know some pretty obscure songs. My big criticism is the set up. If you don't have a reservation and/or come later in the evening, it's difficult to get seats. Believe me, I don't mind standing, but it does become a bit awkward when you have to keep scooting over to let waitresses and patrons past you. If you do find a seat, it is often littered with someone else's empty glasses.",3 (4 stars),"Always a good time, although it's definitely not a place I would visit often.

"We just completed our wedding registry at the Homestead location. The customer service was outstanding! One of the employees, Chris, walked around with us to help us pick out exactly what we needed. The wedding registry coordinator, Christina, was also very helpful and accommodating. They treated us as if we were royalty. I would recommend this wedding registry without a doubt!",4 (5 stars),"We just completed our wedding registry at the Homestead location. The customer service was outstanding!

"This place has probably some of the best pastries I've ever encountered. The treats are consistently great to amazing to even mouth watering. The bakery is this quaint little place that is really cute with nice baking decorations and everything. The staff is really friendly and always helpful with making the hard selection. The cupcakes are these cream-stuffed pieces of heaven, and their signature sandwiches are out of this world. Everything else leaves nothing to be desired, and keeps me coming back as frequently as I can find someone to accompany me.",4 (5 stars),This place has probably some of the best pastries I've ever encountered.
